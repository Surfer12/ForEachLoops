2. **Define Relationships**:
    - Use inheritance for interfaces extending other interfaces.
    - Use composition for classes implementing interfaces.
    - Use aggregation for classes using other classes.

3. **Create UML Diagram**:
    - Use a UML tool (like Lucidchart, draw.io, or any UML diagram software) to draw the classes and interfaces.
    - Add fields and methods as described in the document.
    - Add comments to describe the purpose of each class/interface and its methods.

This textual representation can be translated into a visual UML diagram using any UML diagram tool. Each class and interface should include its methods and fields, and relationships should be drawn to represent inheritance and implementation.
